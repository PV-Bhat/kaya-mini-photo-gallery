This is a placeholder for the app preview screenshot.

In a real production environment, you would:
1. Run the application locally
2. Take a screenshot of the main interface
3. Save it as app-preview.png in this directory
4. Replace the placeholder link in the README.md file with the actual screenshot

The app screenshot would show the main feed with Kaya and Mini's photos, demonstrating the Instagram-like interface with the ability to like and comment on photos.
